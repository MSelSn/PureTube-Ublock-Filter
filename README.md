<h2>▶️ PureTube-Ublock-Filter</h2>

This YouTube filter removes most of the unnecessary things on YouTube (at least in my opinion 😁).

Try it out and let me improve it based on your feedback.

<h2>🪛 Setup</h2>

You can view and download the filter [from here](https://github.com/MSelSn/PureTube-Ublock-Filter/blob/main/PureTube.txt).

Download the txt file for **uBlock Origin** (Firefox, etc.) or **uBlock Origin Lite** (Chrome, etc.), then install the filter using the extension’s import option. It’s that simple 👌
